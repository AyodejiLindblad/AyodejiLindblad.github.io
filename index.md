# Welcome to my website.

My CV can be found at [this link](#) and the research papers I've written are listed below:

### Research Papers
* **Designs related through projective and Hopf maps** [In *Discrete & Computational Geometry*]
    Formalizes a construction that builds a spherical $t$-design by placing a spherical $t$-design on each projective or Hopf fiber associated to the points of a $\lfloor t/2 \rfloor$-design on a quotient projective space or sphere $\Sigma$. This generalizes work of König, Kuperberg, and Okuda, who verified the cases when $\Sigma$ is a complex projective space or $S^2$.
* **Asymptotically optimal $t$-design curves on $S^3$** [[arXiv:2408.04044](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04044), submitted for publication]
    Solves the dimension 3 case of the problem posed by Ehler and Gröchenig of proving that there exist asymptotically optimal sequences of $t$-design curves on $S^d$ for $d > 2$.
* **Asymptotically short generalizations of $t$-design curves** [[arXiv:2505.03056](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03056), to be submitted for publication]
    Proves existence of weighted and $\varepsilon_t$-approximate $t$-design curves on $S^d$ of asymptotic order of arc length $t^{d-1}$ for all $d$ in the weighted setting (in which case such curves are asymptotically optimal) and for all odd $d$ in the approximate setting (in which case $\varepsilon_t \asymp 1/t$ as $t \to \infty$). Explicit formulas for such weighted $t$-design curves are given for $d \in \{2, 3\}$. 
* **Dynamical stability of translators under mean curvature flow** [Available on SPUR website]
    Joint w/ Carlos Alvarado, produced under the supervision of Tang-Kai Lee as part of MIT SPUR 2022. Investigates whether certain classes of perturbations of mean curvature flow translators converge to translators under the flow. 
* **Abelianized boundary Dehn twists on connected sums of complete intersections** [Writeup in progress, to be released 1/13/2026].
* **Lifting design curves** [Writeup in progress, to be released 3/3/2026].

### Expository Works
* **Instanton Floer homology and applications** [To appear].
    Notes following a mini-course given by Tom Mrowka and John Baldwin written joint w/ Joye Chen, Ollie Thakar, and Nathan Geist. In specific, I wrote the sections following Tom's lectures joint w/ Tom and Joye and made figures for both the sections following Tom's lectures and those following John's lectures.

### Talks
* **Geometrically designing geometric designs** [3/14/2025 @ MIT PuMaGraSS]
    I discussed geometric constructions of spherical $t$-designs and $t$-design curves.
* **Monopole Floer homology and a refinement of Manolescu** [10/15/2024 @ MIT Juvitop]
    I gave an overview of the construction of monopole Floer homology (as in Ch. 22 of Tom and Peter's book) and discussed a refinement due to Manolescu involving finite-dimensional approximations of the Seiberg-Witten map which produces a space whose homotopy groups are the monopole Floer homology groups.
* **In case you're curious what your local low-dimensional topologists do all day** [10/4/2024 @ MIT PuMaGraSS]
    I spoke about Morse theory and Floer theories.
* **Designs related through projective and Hopf maps** [4/6/2024 @ 2024 AMS Eastern Sectional meeting FRACTals section]
    I discussed my preprint of the same name.

### Meetings Organized
* **The Low-dimensional Princeton-Cambridge Exchange Gathering (the Low PriCE Gathering)** [4/2-4/4/2025 @ MIT and Harvard]
    A meeting on low-dimensional topology which I organized alongside Ollie Thakar. Abstracts from the event can be found [here](#).

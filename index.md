Welcome to my website.


=================================================

My CV can be found [at this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e4w3e4dgLDcC4zWQJk_w8zFAUt9QkYEA/view?usp=drive_link) and the research papers I've written are listed below:

*   [Designs related through projective and Hopf maps](https://rdcu.be/eSi5F) \[[In Discrete & Computational Geometry](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-025-00805-7)\]  
    Formalizes a construction that builds a spherical t\-design by placing a spherical t\-design on each projective or Hopf fiber associated to the points of a ⌊t/2⌋-design on a quotient projective space or sphere Σ. This generalizes work of [König](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/article?mr=1797231), [Kuperberg](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/040615584), and [Okuda](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08414), who verified the cases when Σ is a complex projective space or S2.
    
*   [Asymptotically optimal t\-design curves on S3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WUC5eNBkv4DSW_V0KPvPMj1BRw4jKUGt/view?usp=drivesdk) \[[arXiv:2408.04044](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04044), submitted for publication\]  
    Solves the dimension 3 case of the problem posed by [Ehler and Gröchenig](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375872452_t_-Design_Curves_and_Mobile_Sampling_on_the_Sphere) of proving that there exist asymptotically optimal sequences of t\-design curves on Sd for d > 2.
    
*   [Asymptotically short generalizations of t\-design curves](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AzJJJvKVxr380cAapRny8Pr8qEjeXrdZ/view?usp=drivesdk) \[[arXiv:2505.03056](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03056), to be submitted for publication\]  
    Proves existence of weighted and εt\-approximate t\-design curves on Sd of asymptotic order of arc length td-1 for all d in the weighted setting (in which case such curves are asymptotically optimal) and for all odd d in the approximate setting (in which case εt ≍ 1/t as t → ∞). Explicit formulas for such weighted t\-design curves are given for d ∈ {2, 3}. 
    
*   [Dynamical stability of translators under mean curvature flow](https://math.mit.edu/research/undergraduate/spur/documents/2022/Alvarado_Linblad.pdf) \[[Available on SPUR website](https://math.mit.edu/research/undergraduate/spur/past-projects.html)\]  
    Joint w/ [Carlos Alvarado](https://alvarado-alvarez.github.io/), produced under the supervision of [Tang-Kai Lee](https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=2273) as part of [MIT SPUR](https://math.mit.edu/research/undergraduate/spur/) 2022. Investigates whether certain classes of perturbations of mean curvature flow translators converge to translators under the flow. 
    
*   Abelianized boundary Dehn twists on connected sums of complete intersections \[Writeup in progress, to be released 1/13/2026\].
    
*   Lifting design curves \[Writeup in progress, to be released 3/3/2026\].
        

Some expository works I've written can also be found below:

*   Instanton Floer homology and applications \[[To appear](https://link.springer.com/book/9783032134936)\].  
    Notes following a [mini-course](https://erdoscenter.renyi.hu/events/conference-new-structures-low-dimensional-topology) given by [Tom Mrowka](https://math.mit.edu/~mrowka/) and [John Baldwin](https://sites.google.com/bc.edu/john-baldwin/home) written joint w/ [Joye Chen](https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=2584), [Ollie Thakar](https://www.math.harvard.edu/people/thakar-ollie/), and [Nathan Geist](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/morrissey/departments/math/people/grad-students/nathan-geist.html). In specific, I wrote the sections following Tom's lectures joint w/ Tom and Joye and made figures for both the sections following Tom's lectures and those following John's lectures.
        

The following are talks I've given:

*   [Geometrically designing geometric designs](https://photos.app.goo.gl/S6Uhk84pSQmK99BE8) \[3/14/2025 @ [MIT PuMaGraSS](https://math.mit.edu/pumagrass/)\]  
    I discussed geometric constructions of [spherical t\-designs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x8kh1ir3qsDPOWAqWsjstV5C3obETxlV/view?usp=sharing) and [t\-design curves](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HlHE2oS-M53LNbNKoZkpfpfi2fw-S6Yq/view?usp=sharing).
    
*   Monopole Floer homology and a refinement of Manolescu \[10/15/2024 @ [MIT Juvitop](https://math.mit.edu/juvitop/)\]  
    I gave an overview of the construction of monopole Floer homology (as in Ch. 22 of [Tom and Peter's book](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/monopoles-and-threemanifolds/24DFD24BB25BDDCFE28810998F5B6242)) and discussed a [refinement due to Manolescu](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0104024) involving finite-dimensional approximations of the Seiberg-Witten map which produces a space whose homotopy groups are the monopole Floer homology groups.
    
*   In case you're curious what your local low-dimensional topologists do all day \[10/4/2024 @ [MIT PuMaGraSS](https://math.mit.edu/pumagrass/)\]  
    I spoke about Morse theory and Floer theories.
    
*   [Designs related through projective and Hopf maps](https://meetings.ams.org/math/spring2024e/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/34013) \[4/6/2024 @ 2024 AMS Eastern Sectional meeting [FRACTals](https://www.ams.org/meetings/sectional/2312_program_ss15.html) section\]  
    [I](https://www.instagram.com/p/C5qjPnHsUVS/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw%3D%3D&img_index=2) discussed my preprint of the same name.
    

The following are meetings I've organized:

*   [The Low-dimensional Princeton-Cambridge Exchange Gathering (the Low PriCE Gathering)](https://sites.google.com/view/ayodeji-lowpricegathering/home) \[4/2-4/4/2025 @ MIT and Harvard\]  
    A meeting on low-dimensional topology which I organized alongside [Ollie Thakar](https://www.math.harvard.edu/people/thakar-ollie/). Abstracts from the event can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eQs8u07aWJ1T0SiU6org20qM1ncSOUr5/view?usp=drivesdk).
